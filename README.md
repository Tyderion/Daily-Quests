# Daily Quests
This will be an application where you can do the following features:
- Be remembered to do something (a Quest) at a (more or less) convenient time of the day
- Have lists with items in it and when there is not enough of an item, it will make a Quest for you to get this item.
- Users can only see their own lists or lists they've been invited to or public lists.
- Users can select from all public Items that are in the database.
- Items and Lists can be created as private or public.
. An item can be anything, for example 
> - a thing: e.g. a shovel
> - a task: e.g. clean the toilet etc
